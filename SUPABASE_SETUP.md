## âœ… Verification

After setup, your portfolio will:
- âœ… Load projects from the database
- âœ… Allow full admin management at `/admin`
- âœ… Support file uploads (if storage is configured)
- âœ… Persist all changes to the cloud database

## ðŸ”§ Current Status

**Without Supabase setup**: The portfolio works with fallback data from local JSON files. The admin panel will show warnings but won't persist changes.

**With Supabase setup**: Full functionality with cloud database, real-time updates, and file storage.

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Missing Supabase environment variables"**
   - Check your `.env` file has the correct values
   - Restart the dev server after updating `.env`

2. **Database connection errors**
   - Verify your project URL and API key are correct
   - Check if your Supabase project is active

3. **Migration errors**
   - Make sure you run both migration files in order
   - Check the SQL Editor for any error messages

4. **Storage upload errors**
   - Ensure the `portfolio-media` bucket exists
   - Verify the bucket is set to public

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

Once Supabase is configured:
1. Visit `/admin` to manage your portfolio content
2. Upload your professional photos and documents
3. Customize your projects, experience, and skills
4. Your changes will be automatically saved to the cloud!
